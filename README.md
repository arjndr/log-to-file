# log-to-file

This module writes a log file instead of logging into the `console`

Use `console.log()`, `console.warn()` or `console.info()` functions to log-to-file and `console.clear()` to clear the log file

## How to use :
1. Require the module 
```js
  var LogToFile = require('./logtofile.js')
```
2. Initialize **log-to-file**
```js
  LogToFile()
```
3. Log some stuff, you should see a "log.txt" file in the directory.

#### Huge improvements on the way! Stay tuned.
